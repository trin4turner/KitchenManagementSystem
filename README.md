This is a fast food kitchen order simulator, where users can order sodas and different types of burgers in varying quantities. 
It reads off of a text file, and creates the order objects from it.
It can then accept new burger orders, and write a new file.
At the end of execution, it will generate two different reports for the store owener: "End of day report" and the " Updated orders".
